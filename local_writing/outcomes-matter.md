ðŸ”´ Outcomes Matter

Story

When I joined Figma, it was small enough for me to set up a coffee date with every employee. Everyone sat in a big room above a bar and coffee shop so every day for my first two months, Iâ€™d grab someone and go to the coffee stand downstairs to get to know them.

I loved the people I met and continued working at Figma for years. The company grew and grew and grew. It was exciting and partially so because as an early employee, a decent part of my compensation came in the form stock options. My initial largest equity grant vested over four years. As the end date approached, I was concerned about my on-paper compensation would suddenly drop significantly when the grant was fully vested so I decided to bring it up with my boss.

Fearing confrontation, I decided not to simply ask for a raise. My boss had joined earlier than me and presumably had the same problem, so I decided to ask how he thought about it and secretly hope he would decide to give me a raise. At our next one-on-one in a glass-enclosed conference rooms, I went for it.

Sometimes I ask for advice but donâ€™t have high hopes. Iâ€™ll throw out a question and get something bland or forgettable. But this one really stuck with me.

My boss said he considered his compensation differently. He experienced a significant drop in shares vesting each month, but as long as he had his job, he could influence their value. He thought like an owner rather than an employee.

Principles

In school, we get assignments, do our best, and get a grade. As long as we work to the best of our abilities, we continue to advance. Leaving this mindset is one of the hardest parts of transitioning from school to career.

As a junior employee, you're given specific tasks to complete. With more responsibility comes autonomy to identify what is important to work on and what is not. You might make decisions for others or teams, and it's not just about doing your best to make a good choice â€” you need to get it right.

At some point, as you advance in your career, you cross over from completing tasks to measuring yourself against the results of your actions.
