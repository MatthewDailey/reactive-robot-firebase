🔴 Communication

Story

In spring 2016, I worked at a seed stage start-up called “Radical Candor,” founded by Kim Scott and Russ Laraway to build software to help managers become better managers. I coded in the back seat of a Lyft on the way to our office in the Flintstone House 45 minutes south of San Francisco.

One morning after just finishing my ride to work, Russ, TJ (the other engineer), and I were sitting around the dining room table waiting for the team to gather for a morning meeting. Russ was explaining something about the business strategy to us. Russ and I didn’t often work closely, so I was enjoying his perspective. But then I noticed Russ repeat himself a couple times and expound on key points. Eventually I thought to myself, “Okay Russ, you can stop. I f-ing get it.”

And then something magic happened. He stopped talking and the conversation moved on. It was like Russ had read my mind and knew he’d gotten his point across. It wasn’t that Russ just liked the sound of his own voice. He was communicating as a leader, ensuring TJ and I were completely clear on the strategy. We didn’t talk often with Russ but after that conversation, he could be certain we would be operating with an understanding of the broader strategy.

Principles

When communicating as a leader, you don’t want the team to “mostly get it” or “sort of get it”. You want them to absolutely freaking get it.

Engineers tend to speak in a technically correct manner. They are accustomed to communicating with computers and teaching computers to communicate with each other. Sharing precise information once is ideal for computers. Unfortunately, it's a terrible way to talk to humans.

People need extra context and reiteration. They need you to proactively share, check their understanding and clarify. They need help sorting out the signal from the noise. It’s better to feel like a broken record than have your team working with incomplete or inaccurate information.
