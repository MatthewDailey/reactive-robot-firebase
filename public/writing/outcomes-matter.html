  <b>Story of when I encountered an ownership mentality in action</b>
  <p>When I joined Figma, it was small enough for me to set up a coffee date with every employee. Everyone sat in a big
    room above a bar and coffee shop so every day for my first two months, I’d grab someone and go to the coffee stand
    downstairs to get to know them.</p>

  <p>I loved the people I met and continued working at Figma for years as the company grew. Being part of that growth
    was exhilarating. We kept bringing on amazing new teammates and the metrics kept going up and to the right. It was
    also exciting because, as an early employee, a chunk of my compensation was stock options that kept getting more
    valuable. My initial equity grant vested over four years and as the end date approached, I started to get concerned.
    My on-paper monthly compensation would suddenly drop significantly when the grant was fully vested. I was concerned
    enough that I decided to bring it up with my boss.</p>

  <p>Fearing confrontation, I decided not to simply ask for a raise and this turned out to be a great decision. My boss
    had joined earlier than me and presumably had the same problem at an even bigger scale so I decided to ask how he
    thought about it while secretly hoping he would decide to give me a raise. At our next one-on-one in a
    glass-and-brick enclosed conference room, I went for it.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I ask for advice but don’t have high hopes. I’ll throw out a question and get something bland or
    forgettable. But this one really stuck with me.</p>

  <p>My boss said he considered his compensation differently. He had experienced a significant drop in shares vesting
    each month. However, his mindset was that as long as he had his job, he could influence their value. He recognized
    that if he did his work well, he could increase the value of the shares he already owned and that would be more
    valuable to him in the long run. His mindset was that he was compensated for the outcome of his work rather than the
    input he provided. He thought like an owner rather than an employee.</p>

  <b>Principles for taking responsibility</b>
  <p>In school, we get assignments, do our best, and get a grade. As long as we work to the best of our abilities, we
    continue to advance. This pattern continues as a new grad engineer when advancing from L1 to L2 is a well-lit path.
    Leaving this mindset is one of the hardest parts of transitioning from school to career and then advancing further
    in your career.</p>

  <p>As a junior employee, you're given specific tasks to complete. With more responsibility comes autonomy to identify
    what is important to work on and what is not. At some point, as you advance in your career, you cross over from
    completing tasks to measuring yourself against the results of your actions. You’ll make decisions that affect others
    or even multiple teams, and it's not just about doing your best to make a good choice — you need to get it right.
    This is the point at which you are taking responsibility as a leader and not just contributing.</p>

  <b>Key takeaways</b>
  <p>All that matters is the outcome of your work.</p>

  <p>To be successful in leadership roles, you need to have this mentality.</p>
