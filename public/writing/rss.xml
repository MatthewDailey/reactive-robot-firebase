      <title>Legacy</title>
      <description>We were in a medium-loud public setting at a long high-top table and I was explaining how life changed after having kids to a friend without kids. I told them I'd never cared about the idea of "legacy" but I get it now holding my children and realizing that they are the only things I've created or will ever create that will go on beyond me.</description>

      <title>Burnout happens</title>
      <link>https://reactiverobot.com/writing/burnout.html</link>
      <author>matt@reactiverobot.com (Matt Dailey)</author>
      <description>I love long road trips and letting my thoughts drift while I drive. It can be
        really creative and energizing, and I often ask my wife to jot down an idea and text it to
        me so I don't lose it. But sometimes my thoughts drift into rough waters. I get stuck on
        something and start turning it over and over in my mind, getting more and more worked up.</description>

      <title>Hiring is emotional</title>
      <link>https://reactiverobot.com/writing/hiring.html</link>
      <description>When I'm stressed about work, I pace around the house. I work in our bedroom so I
        walk back and forth at the foot
        of the bed. My pacing is a mix of silent rehearsal and fist pumping to psych myself up. But
        for one call in winter
        2022, I struggled to get in the zone.</description>

      <title>Code review is your job</title>
      <description>When I started at Palantir, my desk was in a typical Silicon Valley office space.
        My team was in a room with six
        standing desks, no windows and a huge purple bean bag in the corner. I came back to my desk
        one afternoon feeling
        pretty good. I had just sent one my first decently large PRs for review and I was proud of
        it.</description>

      <title>Always be pitching</title>
      <description>While managing the Growth team at Figma, I worked from home in a small,
        downstairs one-bedroom with two rooms. I
        worked in the bedroom and my wife Courtney worked in the everything-else room.</description>

      <title>Only outcomes matter</title>
      <description>When I joined Figma, it was small enough for me to set up a coffee date with every employee. Everyone sat in a big
    room above a bar and coffee shop so every day for my first two months, I’d grab someone and go to the coffee stand
    downstairs to get to know them.</description>

      <title>Leveling up hurts</title>
      <description>I quit the startup before Figma after just 3 months. It's not on my LinkedIn so you can't look it up. It wasn't the right role for me but I went for it, partly due to the higher pay. They offered way more than I made previously, which turned out to be pretty unfortunate.</description>

      <title>I want you to f-ing get it</title>
      <link>https://reactiverobot.com/writing/communication.html</link>
      <author>matt@reactiverobot.com (Matt Dailey)</author>
      <description>In spring 2016, I worked at a seed stage start-up called “Radical Candor,” founded by Kim Scott and Russ Laraway to
    build software to help managers become better managers. Everyday I coded in the back seat of a Lyft on Highway 280
    as I rode to our office in the Flintstone House, 45 minutes south of San Francisco.</description>
