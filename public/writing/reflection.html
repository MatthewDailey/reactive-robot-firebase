  <b>Story of when I met my favorite meeting</b>
  <p>My favorite meeting genre is Reflection. It’s a meeting where everyone writes stickies with likes and wishes, then
    shares and clusters them into themes. That’s a normal retrospective process but what makes Reflection special is
    that we don’t wait for something big to happen to do it. Instead, we reflect every week.</p>

  <p>It looks different with every team. Sometimes it’s part of the planning process, sometimes a vigorous debate, and
    sometimes a love fest.</p>

  <p>The first time I did this was at Radical Candor, a seed stage startup in a shared space in an old SF office
    building. The team was wonderful but a bit of a hodgepodge. When my friend and I joined, the initial product hadn't
    been launched and the team consisted of two non-technical founders, a product lead, two remote engineers, and a team
    of design and engineering contractors.</p>

  <p>The company's goal was to provide tools to help managers improve. We had an ace-in-the-hole with the Radical Candor
    brand and associated content. However, the exact product shape needed to be figured out. All of that is par for the
    course as an early stage startup, but it was a recipe for chaos and miscommunication. We had a bunch of people
    working together for the first time to build a vaguely defined product.</p>

  <p>We were pursuing the main idea of the Candor Coach, a management coach in your pocket. It would guide you through
    exercises and content to practice managerial skills, primarily giving and receiving feedback. However, building it
    involved sorting out a ton of ambiguities. For example, our design contractor shared a beautiful design that
    everyone loved for a popup reminder to simulate your coach checking in on you. The premise of the feature was that
    we would engage the user at the perfect time. Unfortunately, the designer didn’t specify any conditions to show the
    popup, just that it would show up right when it was most useful. I was left to figure out the details and I was
    frustrated to say the least. I like to go for walks when I’m angry and I went for a nice long one.</p>

  <p>We were struggling as a pre-product market fit company and I wasn’t alone in having big feelings. Fortunately, the
    contractors we were working with had processes to help teams in our situation, the most powerful of which was
    Reflection.</p>

  <p>We met on a Friday around a big wooden table in a conference room with walls covered in sketches and mock-ups and
    they explained the process. We wrote down our likes and wishes, shared with the group, and discussed. We had a lot
    of “wishes” and a heated discussion ensued. But we also had a lot of “likes” when we appreciated each other’s work
    and progress we’d made as a team. It led to a group catharsis when everyone vented frustrations and was appreciated
    for their contributions. We resolved ambiguities and adjusted our course for the next week until we reflected again
    the next Friday.</p>

  <p>I walked out of the office feeling amazing. We had productive conflict and I felt more bonded to the team. We were
    doing something hard, doing it together and as long as we kept reflecting on our work and collaboration, I felt like
    we couldn’t fail.</p>

  <b>Principles of Reflection</b>
  <p>Teams need to iterate on what's working and what’s not. It should be safe and encouraged for people to share
    problems they’re facing.</p>

  <p>Teammates need to openly appreciate each other. Everyone wants to feel valued and just hearing it from a manager
    every 6 months isn’t enough. It’s unfortunately common for people to see good work by a peer but say nothing,
    especially for distributed teams.</p>

  <p>As a manager, it's your job to cultivate the team’s culture. If you want a team that values feedback and iterative
    work, you need to make those things a regular part of the team’s processes.</p>

  <p>Once the team is comfortable sharing in Reflection, it becomes a powerful tool for a manager to debug issues.
    Instead of having numerous one-on-one conversations and triangulating larger themes, you can facilitate the team
    figuring it out together. They will hash out issues, change course nimbly, and everyone will feel part of the
    decision.</p>

  <b>Key Takeaways</b>
  <p>Conflict and confusion are part of work and it’s a manager’s responsibility to help the team resolve them.</p>

  <p>Running a regular Reflection is an effective way to surface and address any issues quickly.</p>

  <p>Reflection encourages praise between teammates which helps the team bond.</p>
