  <p>
    Code review is a tool to help a developer do their job better. It's purpose is to help write
    the best code possible as efficiently as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    A code author should take responsibility for their code all the way from the IDE to production. This means as part
    of the code review process they are responsible for:
  <ul>
    <li>Requesting review from the right people.</li>
    <li>Pointing reviewers to the parts of the code most needing attention.</li>
    <li>Ensuring reviewers have context to be effective and efficient.</li>
    <li>Nudging reviewers to get the review done in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    As a reviewer, your job is to be a resource to the developer. How exactly you do that will
    vary widely but universally you should be curious and supportive. When you have concerns be clear and direct but
    also make sure to comment on things you learned or that they did well.
  </p>

  <p>Time spent reviewing other's code is often the highest leverage! The other person did all the hard work of
    actually writing the code and now you can help get it over the finish line.</p>
