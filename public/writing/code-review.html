  <h1><a href="/writing" id="writing">writing /</a> Code Review</h1>

  <p>
    The purpose of code review is to write the best code possible as efficiently as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    A code author should take responsibility for their code all the way from development to production. This means
    during code review they are responsible for:
  <ul>
    <li>Requesting review from the right people.</li>
    <li>Pointing reviewers to the parts of the code most needing attention and asking questions.</li>
    <li>Ensuring reviewers have context to be effective and efficient.</li>
    <li>Nudging reviewers to get the review done in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    As a reviewer, your job is to be a resource to the developer. How you do that will
    vary based on the situation but universally you should be curious and supportive. The author is your teammate and
    has good intent, they are not an advisary trying to ruin your perfect playground. When you have concerns be clear
    and direct but also make sure to comment on things you learned and that they did well.
  </p>

  <p>Time spent reviewing other's code is often the highest leverage time for a developer. The author did all the
    hard work of actually writing the code and now you can help get it over the finish line.</p>
